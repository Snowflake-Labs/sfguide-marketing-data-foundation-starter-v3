# Marketing Data Foundation Starter

## Introduction

Customers looking to use Snowflake for marketing use cases initially face a significant challenge: it is difficult to import all relevant marketing data into Snowflake and structure it in a unified format that downstream applications can easily utilize to power data-driven marketing.

This starter solution tackles this challenge of creating a marketing data foundation by offering two independent solutions and a merged version, demonstrating how to integrate both solutions into a comprehensive 'marketing app suite'. 
- Marketing Data Foundation Starter (Merges the two apps below into a ‘marketing app suite’)
  - [Data Foundation Starter for Customer 360](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-marketing-data-foundation-starter-customer-360)
  - [Data Foundation Starter for Campaign Intelligence](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-marketing-data-foundation-starter-campaign-intelligence)

This solution was inspired by how Snowflake runs its own end-to-end Marketing workflows entirely on top of the Snowflake Marketing Data Cloud.
